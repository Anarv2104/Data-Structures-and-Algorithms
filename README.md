# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Topic-wise DSA practice in Java for placements and interviews. Includes patterns, logic, and problem-solving flow.

## DSA Java Prep

This repository contains my structured Data Structures & Algorithms preparation in **Java**, focused on cracking placement interviews for service-based and product-based companies.

## 📚 What You'll Find

- ✅ Topic-wise Java implementations
- ✅ Logic-first approach with dry runs and patterns
- ✅ LeetCode & Blind 75 mapped questions
- ✅ Step-by-step breakdowns, not just solutions

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- [x] Arrays & Prefix Sums  
- [x] Strings & Sliding Window  
- [x] Hashing & Two Pointer  
- [x] Stack & Queue  
- [x] Linked List  
- [x] Trees & BST

## 🚀 How I’m Learning

1. Learn the concept (via Apna College / trusted sources)
2. Dry run with pen & paper  
3. Code from scratch (no copying)
4. Add patterns + logic comments
5. Revisit failed problems weekly

---

## 📌 Goal

Get placement-ready with clean Java DSA logic and build confidence for solving real interview problems.
