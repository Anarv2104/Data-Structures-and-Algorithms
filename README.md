# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Topic-wise DSA practice in Java for placements and interviews. Includes patterns, logic, and problem-solving flow.

## DSA Java Prep

This repository contains my structured Data Structures & Algorithms preparation in **Java**, focused on cracking placement interviews for service-based and product-based companies.

## ðŸš€ How Iâ€™m Learning

1. Learn the concept (via Apna College / trusted sources)
2. Dry run with pen & paper  
3. Code from scratch (no copying)
4. Add patterns + logic comments
5. Revisit failed problems weekly

---

## ðŸ“Œ Goal

Get placement-ready with clean Java DSA logic and build confidence for solving real interview problems.
